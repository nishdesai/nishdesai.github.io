## About

I am an engineer and researcher experienced in modern machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. I am currently working at UnifyID, and I was previously a graduate student in computer science at UC Berkeley. At Berkeley, I was associated with Berkeley Artificial Intelligence (BAIR) Lab and Center for Human-Compatible AI (CHAI) and worked primarily on problems in AI Safety. I also completed my undergraduate studies in computer science and statistics at Berkeley.
