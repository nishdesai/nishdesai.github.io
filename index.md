## About

I am an engineer and researcher experienced in modern machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. I am currently working at [UnifyID](https://unify.id), and I was previously a student in computer science at UC Berkeley where I completed my B.A. in Computer Science and Statistics and my M.S. in Computer Science. While at Berkeley, I was associated with [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence (BAIR) Lab](https://bair.berkeley.edu) and the [Center for Human-Compatible AI (CHAI)](https://humancompatible.ai/) and worked primarily on problems in AI Alignment.
